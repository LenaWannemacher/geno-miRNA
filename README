README

    geno-miRNA is a genome-wide miRNA alignment and analysis tool.
    It can operate using any reference genome FASTA file plus the corresponding gene annotation GFF3 file
    and any amount of miRNA sequences (summarized into one FASTA file).

    The program uses an alignment algorithm to evaluate every hit found.
    The output consists of a statistics table and all the alignment-files for each individual miRNA by
    default.

HOW TO OBTAIN THE PROGRAM

    To download the latest version of geno-miRNA you can visit the GIT website:
    
    https://github.com/LenaWannemacher/geno-miRNA.git

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM

    The program works as follows:

    --align   miRNA.fa   reference_genome.fa   gene_annotation.gff3   config.json   tmp_dir_location   output_dir_location

    Every variable in the config file can be adjusted to your desire. A detailed explanation on the variables
    is given below.
    
    In order to properly use the program, please create a folder "tmp_dir" and "output_dir". The paths of these folders 
    must be passed to the program as arguments.

CONFIG.json

    Here, the properties of the config.json file are listed.

    - match:        The score of a match of two base pairs.
    - g_u_wobble:   The score of GU-wobble pairing.
    - penalty:      The penalty score for mismatches.
    - gap_open_pen: The penalty score for a gap opening.
    - gap_ext_pen": The penalty score for a gap extension.
    - scaling_factor:   The scaling factor for the first eleven position. This is a float type.
    - threshold:    The points threshold for an alignment.
    - token_size:   The length of the ”word” that is searched in the genome.
    - overhang:     The length of the overhang of the DNA sequence around a match.
    - wobble_region:    Can be 0 or 1. If this value is set to 1, the algorithm adds a rule that analyzes the ”wobble region”, 
                                       i.e. evaluates the sequence from position six to twelve. No mismatches are then allowed
                                       in this region.
    - output_alignment: Can be 0 or 1. If set to 1, the program will
                                       produce the alignment output files.
    - output_statistics:    Can be 0 or 1. If set to 1, the program will
                                           produce the statistic tables.
